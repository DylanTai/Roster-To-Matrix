# Excel Conversion Utility

This repository holds a tiny Python tool that reads an Excel workbook and writes
it back out (optionally tweaking headers or removing blank rows). The same
conversion logic powers both a command-line interface and a minimal Tk GUI so a
non-technical teammate can select files without typing paths.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Command-line usage

```bash
python excel_converter.py input.xlsx output.xlsx [--uppercase-headers] [--drop-empty-rows]
```

- If you provide both positional arguments, the tool writes to the path you
  specify.
- If you omit the output file, the converter saves alongside the input file
  using the pattern `YYMMDD-HHMM-<OriginalName>.xlsx` (e.g.,
  `251103-2342-CourseAssignment.xlsx`).
- Leaving out both arguments launches the interactive prompts described below.

### Prompt-driven mode

If you omit the positional arguments, the script walks you through selecting
directories and filenames:

1. When asked for a directory, enter a relative path using `/`, `\\`, or `..`
   (e.g., `../Downloads`). Any other input—or simply pressing Enter—defaults to
   the current working directory.
2. Provide the exact workbook filename that lives inside that directory.
3. As soon as the input file is confirmed, the tool previews the autogenerated
   output path with the timestamped filename shown above.

## Course assignment sheet

The converter reads only the workbook's first sheet (e.g., your `2025-26` roster)
and writes a *new* workbook that contains a single `CourseAssignment` sheet:

- Each row lists a course (taken from `Course Name`).
- Columns after the first correspond to each `LocName`, ordered by first
  appearance in the roster.
- Cell contents are the date range in `yy/mm/dd - yy/mm/dd` format plus the
  `JobStatus` (e.g., `25/09/18 - 25/12/18 CANCELED`). Subsequent matches for the
  same course/location are stacked on separate lines.

This mirrors the sample tab you provided but fills in the date range so it never
has to be entered manually. Since only the generated sheet is written, the
output file stays small and focused.

## Simple GUI

```bash
python excel_converter.py --gui
```

Click **Browse…** to select the source workbook; the output path is filled in
automatically using the timestamped naming convention. Press **Convert** to run
the transformation. A message box confirms success or shows any errors (missing
file, locked workbook, etc.).

## Next steps

* Add your real business logic inside `convert_workbook`.
* Ship the tool as a standalone app via `pyinstaller` or `briefcase` once the
  workflow is finalized.
